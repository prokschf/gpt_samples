The core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary are:

1. `HTMLExtractor`: A class that will handle the extraction of text from the HTML file. It will have the following methods:
   - `__init__(self, file_path)`: Initializes the HTMLExtractor with the path to the HTML file.
   - `extract_text(self)`: Extracts the text from the "h", "div", and "p" tags in the HTML file.

2. `SQLQueryBuilder`: A class that will handle the creation of the SQL query. It will have the following methods:
   - `__init__(self, table_name)`: Initializes the SQLQueryBuilder with the name of the table to insert into.
   - `insert(self, headline, content)`: Creates an SQL query to insert the given headline and content into the table.

3. `main`: A function that will serve as the entry point for the program. It will create an instance of `HTMLExtractor`, extract the text from the HTML file, create an instance of `SQLQueryBuilder`, and create the SQL query.

Now, let's write the code for each of these components.

html_extractor.py
```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

class HTMLExtractor:
    def __init__(self, file_path):
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            self.soup = BeautifulSoup(file.read(), 'html.parser')

    def extract_text(self):
        text = ''
        for tag in ['h1', 'h2', 'h3', 'h4', 'h5', 'h6', 'div', 'p']:
            elements = self.soup.find_all(tag)
            for element in elements:
                text += ' ' + element.get_text()
        return text.strip()
```

sql_query_builder.py
```python
class SQLQueryBuilder:
    def __init__(self, table_name):
        self.table_name = table_name

    def insert(self, headline, content):
        query = f"INSERT INTO {self.table_name} (headline, content) VALUES ('{headline}', '{content}');"
        return query
```

main.py
```python
from html_extractor import HTMLExtractor
from sql_query_builder import SQLQueryBuilder

def main():
    extractor = HTMLExtractor('path_to_your_html_file.html')
    text = extractor.extract_text()

    builder = SQLQueryBuilder('articles')
    query = builder.insert('Your Headline', text)

    print(query)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Please replace `'path_to_your_html_file.html'` with the actual path to your HTML file and `'Your Headline'` with the actual headline you want to use.
