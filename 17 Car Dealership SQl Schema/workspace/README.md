Based on the requirements, we will need to create an SQL schema with four tables: `Cars`, `Owners`, `Employees`, and `Purchases`. 

The `Cars` table will store information about the cars available at the dealership, including their brand, model, year of construction, color, mileage, and condition. 

The `Owners` table will store information about the owners of the cars, including their name, phone number, address, and email. 

The `Employees` table will store information about the employees selling the cars, including their names. 

The `Purchases` table will store information about the purchases made for a car, including who bought it, at what price, at what date, and which employee sold it. 

The `Purchases` table will have foreign keys referencing the `Cars`, `Owners`, and `Employees` tables to establish the relationships between these entities.

Here is the SQL code to create these tables:
