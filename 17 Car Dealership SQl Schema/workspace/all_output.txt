Based on the requirements, we will need to create an SQL schema with four tables: `Cars`, `Owners`, `Employees`, and `Purchases`. 

The `Cars` table will store information about the cars available at the dealership, including their brand, model, year of construction, color, mileage, and condition. 

The `Owners` table will store information about the owners of the cars, including their name, phone number, address, and email. 

The `Employees` table will store information about the employees selling the cars, including their names. 

The `Purchases` table will store information about the purchases made for a car, including who bought it, at what price, at what date, and which employee sold it. 

The `Purchases` table will have foreign keys referencing the `Cars`, `Owners`, and `Employees` tables to establish the relationships between these entities.

Here is the SQL code to create these tables:

schema.sql
```sql
CREATE TABLE Cars (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    brand VARCHAR(50),
    model VARCHAR(50),
    year_of_construction INT,
    color VARCHAR(20),
    mileage INT,
    condition VARCHAR(20)
);

CREATE TABLE Owners (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    phone_number VARCHAR(15),
    address VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Employees (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Purchases (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    car_id INT,
    owner_id INT,
    employee_id INT,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    date_of_purchase DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (car_id) REFERENCES Cars(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (owner_id) REFERENCES Owners(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES Employees(id)
);
```

This SQL schema can be used to manage the data of a car dealership. The `Cars`, `Owners`, `Employees`, and `Purchases` tables can be populated with the appropriate data, and SQL queries can be used to retrieve and manipulate this data as needed.
