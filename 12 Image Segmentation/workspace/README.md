Given the requirements, we will need to use Python and the following libraries: argparse, requests, PIL, torch, torchvision, and torchvision.transforms. We will use a pre-trained model from torchvision, specifically the DeepLabV3 model trained on a COCO dataset, for image segmentation.

The core classes, functions, and methods necessary are:

1. `download_image(url: str) -> Image`: This function will take a URL as input and return a PIL Image object. It will use the requests library to download the image data and PIL to open the image.

2. `segment_image(image: Image) -> List[str]`: This function will take a PIL Image object as input and return a list of strings representing the objects in the image. It will use the torchvision.transforms library to transform the image into a format suitable for the model, run the image through the model, and then interpret the output to identify the objects.

3. `main()`: This function will handle command line arguments using argparse, call the other functions, and print the output.

The code will be contained in a single file, `image_segmentation.py`.
