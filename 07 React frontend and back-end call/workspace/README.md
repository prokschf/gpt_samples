The core classes, functions, and methods necessary for this project are:

1. `App`: This is the main React component that will contain all other components and manage the state of the application.

2. `SearchBox`: This is a React component that will render the search box and handle the auto-complete feature using the Google Places API.

3. `WeatherTable`: This is a React component that will render the weather information in a table format.

4. `fetchWeatherData`: This is a function that will fetch the weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

5. `handlePlaceSelect`: This is a function that will handle the event when a place is selected from the auto-complete suggestions.

Now, let's write the code for each of these components and functions.

First, we need to create a `package.json` file to manage our NodeJS dependencies.
