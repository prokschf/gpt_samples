The core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary are:

1. `HTMLParser`: A class that inherits from `html.parser.HTMLParser` to parse the HTML file and extract articles. It will have the following methods:
   - `handle_starttag`: To handle the start of an HTML tag.
   - `handle_endtag`: To handle the end of an HTML tag.
   - `handle_data`: To handle the data inside an HTML tag.
   - `get_articles`: To return the extracted articles.

2. `generate_sql_query`: A function to generate the SQL query to insert the extracted articles into the database.

3. `main`: The main function to tie everything together. It will read the HTML file, extract the articles, generate the SQL query, and print the query.

Now, let's write the code for each file.

main.py
