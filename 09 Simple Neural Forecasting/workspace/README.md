The core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary are:

1. `TemperaturePredictor`: This class will encapsulate the LSTM model and its associated methods.
2. `__init__`: This method will initialize the `TemperaturePredictor` class.
3. `prepare_data`: This function will prepare the input data for training the LSTM model.
4. `train`: This method will train the LSTM model on the input data.
5. `predict`: This method will use the trained LSTM model to predict the next 20 temperatures.

The Python files that will be created are:

1. `temperature_predictor.py`: This file will contain the `TemperaturePredictor` class and its associated methods.
2. `main.py`: This file will be the entry point of the program. It will create an instance of the `TemperaturePredictor` class, train the model, and make predictions.
3. `requirements.txt`: This file will list all the Python packages that need to be installed for the program to run.

Now, let's write the code for each file.
