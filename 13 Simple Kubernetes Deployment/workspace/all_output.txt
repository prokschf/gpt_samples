Given the requirements, we will need to create the following Kubernetes manifest files:

1. `backend-deployment.yaml`: This file will define the Deployment for the backend Python application running on an Nginx base image. The Deployment will ensure that three replicas of the backend application are always running.

2. `frontend-deployment.yaml`: This file will define the Deployment for the frontend React application. The Deployment will ensure that three replicas of the frontend application are always running.

3. `backend-service.yaml`: This file will define a Service that exposes the backend Deployment on a set network port within the cluster. This allows the frontend pods to communicate with the backend pods.

4. `frontend-service.yaml`: This file will define a Service that exposes the frontend Deployment on a set network port within the cluster. This allows the AWS Elastic Load Balancer to route external HTTP traffic from port 443 (HTTPS) to the frontend pods on port 8080.

Let's start with the `backend-deployment.yaml` file:

backend-deployment.yaml
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: backend
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: backend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: backend
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: backend
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

Next, we have the `frontend-deployment.yaml` file:

frontend-deployment.yaml
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: frontend
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: frontend
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

Then, we have the `backend-service.yaml` file:

backend-service.yaml
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: backend-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: backend
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
```

Finally, we have the `frontend-service.yaml` file:

frontend-service.yaml
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: frontend-service
  annotations:
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-backend-protocol: http
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-ports: "443"
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: frontend
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 443
      targetPort: 8080
```

Please note that the `frontend-service.yaml` file includes annotations to configure the AWS Elastic Load Balancer to listen on port 443 (HTTPS) and route traffic to the frontend pods on port 8080.
