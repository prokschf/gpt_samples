The architecture of the calculator tool will consist of two main parts:

1. A Calculator class that will perform the mathematical operations.
2. A main function that will handle the command line input and output.

The Calculator class will have the following methods:

- `add`: Adds two numbers.
- `subtract`: Subtracts the second number from the first.
- `multiply`: Multiplies two numbers.
- `divide`: Divides the first number by the second. Throws an error if the second number is zero.
- `power`: Raises the first number to the power of the second. Throws an error if the power is not an integer.

The main function will:

- Parse the command line input.
- Create an instance of the Calculator class.
- Call the appropriate method of the Calculator class based on the operation specified in the command line input.
- Print the result of the operation.
- Handle any errors that occur during the operation.

Now, let's write the code for each part of the architecture.

calculator.py
```python
class Calculator:
    def add(self, num1, num2):
        return num1 + num2

    def subtract(self, num1, num2):
        return num1 - num2

    def multiply(self, num1, num2):
        return num1 * num2

    def divide(self, num1, num2):
        if num2 == 0:
            raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero")
        return num1 / num2

    def power(self, num1, num2):
        if not num2.is_integer():
            raise ValueError("Power must be an integer")
        return num1 ** num2
```

main.py
```python
import sys
from calculator import Calculator

def main():
    if len(sys.argv) != 4:
        print("Usage: python main.py number1 operation number2")
        return

    num1, operation, num2 = sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2], sys.argv[3]

    try:
        num1 = float(num1)
        num2 = float(num2)
    except ValueError:
        print("Both numbers must be valid numbers")
        return

    calculator = Calculator()

    if operation == "+":
        result = calculator.add(num1, num2)
    elif operation == "-":
        result = calculator.subtract(num1, num2)
    elif operation == "*":
        result = calculator.multiply(num1, num2)
    elif operation == "/":
        try:
            result = calculator.divide(num1, num2)
        except ValueError as e:
            print(str(e))
            return
    elif operation == "^":
        try:
            result = calculator.power(num1, num2)
        except ValueError as e:
            print(str(e))
            return
    else:
        print("Invalid operation. Must be one of +, -, *, /, ^")
        return

    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

To run the program, the user would type a command like `python main.py 5 + 3` in the command line. The program would then print the result of the operation, which in this case would be `8`.
