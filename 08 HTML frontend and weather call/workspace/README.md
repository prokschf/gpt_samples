The architecture of this project will be divided into three main parts:

1. Front-end: This will be a simple HTML page with JavaScript to handle user interactions and API calls. The main file will be `index.html` and it will use `styles.css` for styling and `main.js` for functionality.

2. Back-end: This will be a simple Node.js server that serves the front-end files and handles API calls to the Google Places and OpenWeatherMap APIs. The main file will be `server.js`.

3. Configuration: This will include a `package.json` file for managing Node.js dependencies and a `.env` file for storing API keys.

Let's start with the `package.json` file:
