I'm sorry, but it's not possible to provide the code you're asking for. The P vs NP problem is a major unsolved problem in computer science. It asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified by a computer can also be quickly solved by a computer. No proof or counterproof has been found to this problem, despite significant effort within the field. Therefore, it's not possible to write a program that provides a proof for this problem.
